# StoryBuilder

This program reads multiple books (read in as text files with all punctuation removed), builds a trigram model from those books, and makes
a new 1000 word story based on the trigram model. A trigram model describes, given some starting word, what 2 words are most likely to come
after that word (this is calculated while reading the text files).

To run this project, just run StoryBuilder.py via command line, or run it through an ide.
